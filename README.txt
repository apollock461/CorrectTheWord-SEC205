The purpose of the code is to randomly select a word from a text file, scramble the word that has been selected, and then have the user 
input the word that they believe is the correct spelling of the scrambled word. Once the user input the word that they believe is 
the correct spelling of the scramble word, the code will check to make sure that word is the spelt correctly. If the word is spelled 
correctly, then the score will increment by one, if the word is not the score will remain the same. Once you have tried the word, you
will be asked if you would like to play again. If the user says yes, it will loop back through the while loop, if the user says no 
it will exit and thank you for playing the game.
